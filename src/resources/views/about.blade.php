                About the People's Archive of Costume
            </h1>
            <p>
                Clothing has been a part of our collective story for as long as there have been humans.
                Museum costume collections all over the world are a testament to the brightest fashion history jewels.
                But what about the rest of the clothing? The dress of that long forgotten relative, passed down from generation to generation for as long as anyone can remember.
                The old breeches found carefully folded, but forgotten, in the bottom of an attic trunk.
                The handful of garments lovingly collected by a private dress history enthusiast.<br>
                <br>
                The People’s Archive of Costume is an entirely online, open access museum, which can be added to be anyone who owns a piece of antique or vintage clothing.
                The aim is to make a collective, easily accessible record of these garments, and turn them into an invaluable resource for study for the whole world.
                Where-as before they may only ever be seen by a handful of people, we plan to share these treasures of history with everyone.<br><br>
                The items don’t need to have been the height of fashion, of the best quality, or have survived in great condition.
                In fact if it’s seen better days so we can peep through the hole in the lining and see how it was made – then more’s the better!
