                What is The People’s Archive of Costume?<br><br>
                The People’s Archive of Costume is an online archive dedicated to the history of costume and dress. The aim of the website is to provide free access to pictures and details about antique and vintage garments owned by regular people to as broad an audience as possible. Each listing comprises of several images, and as much additional information as the owner of the garment wishes to include.
                <br><br>
                What are the benefits to adding an item to the archive?<br><br>
                Even stored under the very best conditions, fabric has a limited life span. Adding photos and details about a garment to the archive creates a permanent record of it for the world, which means it can continue to be studied even if anything should happen to the actual object (heaven forbid). The archive also allows for external links within a garment listing, so for example if you have created a YouTube video about it, or are selling a sewing pattern that you have taken from it, you can direct people that way and increase traffic of relevant viewers to your site.
                <br><br>
                How do I know if my garment is significant enough to go in the archive?<br><br>
                We believe all garments have significance. Going down research rabbit holes in wonderfully niche directions is a mainstay of many dress historians; so you never know what might end up being a useful resource for someone. The bigger the archive is, the more useful it will be, so we welcome every historical garment.
                <br><br>
                How can I add a garment to the archive?<br><br>
                First create an account by clicking the ‘create account’ button. Then…
                <br><br>
                Do I need to photograph my garment if I want to add it to the archive?<br><br>
                Yes, all listings need to include at least one image, although there is space for up to ten images, and the more you can include the better. To go to the page for guidance on taking good photographs, click here. You don’t need a fancy camera, or even a mannequin for the photo to be useful.
                <br><br>
                Can I add a garment to the archive if I don’t know when it was from, or even quite what it is?<br><br>
                If you own a garment that you feel would be of value to the archive but you don’t feel confident dating it or providing further information, then you can select the ‘ask the people’ button when listing it. This will divert your item to a separate section of the website for 1 month before it joins the main archive. During this time other collectors can offer their opinion on its date range or any other queries. At the end of one month, a website administrator will review the opinions and fill out the missing information for you.
                <br><br>
                How do I find out about my garment?<br><br>
                A large amount of information can be learned about a garment just by giving it a good careful look. The form you fill in when adding a garment to the archive asks many questions (you can choose to answer them or ignore them) which will provide you with a good starting point for what kind of things to look for. We are working on producing some additional pages to help with this, but in the meantime, The Australian Dress Register is doing a very similar thing and has some excellent resources. Click here for the link.
                <br><br>
                How many garments can I add to the archive?<br><br>
                As many as you like. The more the merrier.
                <br><br>
                Can I add a hat, a pair of shoes, or jewellery to the archive?<br><br>
                Currently the archive is only set up to be searchable for clothing. We hope in the future to be able to add accessories.
                <br><br>
                Do you have a physical location that I can visit?<br><br>
                The People’s Archive of Costume is entirely online and does not have a physical location that can be visited.
                <br><br>
                Will I have to show people the actual garment?<br><br>
                The archive is an online database that can be shared with people from all over the world. It is not about physical access to the objects. The ownership and/or location of the entries can be withheld for security reasons if you wish.
                <br><br>
                Is the archive available for private study?<br><br>
                All items in the archive are held by separate individuals, so whether they are open to them being studied is at their own discretion. Whenever a garment is added to the archive, the collector has the option to allow viewers to contact them in regards to it. If you wish to enquire about seeing an item, click the ‘contact collector’ button at the bottom of that items page. If this button does not exist on the garment you are viewing, then the collector does not wish to be contacted.
                <br><br>
                Can I use your photos in my own project?<br><br>
                All items in the archive are owned by separate individuals, so whether they are open to the photos being used is at their own discretion. On adding an item to the archive, the collector will select one of the four options below; their selection will be included in the item listing:
                •	The collector places these images in the public domain, so they may be used for non-profit, academic and commercial purposes, without crediting the source.
                •	The collector is happy for the images to be used for non-profit, academic and commerical purposes as long as they are fully and appropriately credited.
                •	The collector is happy for the images to be used for non-profit, academic purposes as long as they are fully and appropriately credited. For commercial usage, please contact us directly for licensing fees.
                •	These images are under copy write.
                <br><br>
                Can I donate to the archive?<br><br>
                All your donations go straight to the upkeep and development of The People’s Archive of Costume. We are a small team of nerds who set this up with no funding, so all contributions are very gratefully received. You can send donations via PayPal/Patreon using this link here.
                <br><br>
                Why does the archive ask for donations?<br><br>
                Although the collection is online rather than in a physical location, there are still numerous running costs (including but not limited to: web hosting, website development and maintenance, archive administration). Donations allows us to continue offering our website as a free access resource, available to as many people as possible.
                <br><br>
                Can you please value a garment for me?<br><br>
                We do not offer a valuation service.
                <br><br>
                Can you offer advice on how to store my antique and vintage garments?<br><br>
                The team behind the archive do not currently consider themselves expert enough in this to feel qualified to offer advice. It is something we are seeking outside assistance with, and hope to add a page on it in due course.
                <br><br>
                Can I borrow a garment?<br><br>
                All items in the archive are held by separate individuals, so whether they are open to them being borrowed is at their own discretion. Whenever a garment is added to the archive, the collector has the option to allow viewers to contact them in regards to it. If you wish to enquire about seeing an item, click the ‘contact collector’ button at the bottom of that items page. If this button does not exist on the garment you are viewing, then the collector does not wish to be contacted.
                If you are an accredited museum that would like to borrow part of our collection for an upcoming exhibition, please contact the collector to discuss further. We do not advise our collectors to lone to private individuals.
